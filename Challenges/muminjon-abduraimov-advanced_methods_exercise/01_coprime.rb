# Write a method, coprime?(num_1, num_2), that accepts two numbers as args.
# The method should return true if the only common divisor between the two numbers is 1.
# The method should return false otherwise. For example coprime?(25, 12) is true because
# 1 is the only number that divides both 25 and 12.

def coprime?(n1, n2)
  res1 = n1.gcd(n2)
  res2 = n2.gcd(n1)

  return true if res1 == 1 && res2 == 1

  false
end

p coprime?(25, 12)    # => true
p coprime?(7, 11)     # => true
p coprime?(30, 9)     # => false
p coprime?(6, 24)     # => false
